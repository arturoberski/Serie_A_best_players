'Serie A best players' presents the table with the best Serie A players. The data is retrieved from the server using the XMLHttpRequest() object and the X-Mashape-Key header request. A JSON file is downloaded from the server, then it is passed to the web page using Javascript. The table was created using Bootstrap.
